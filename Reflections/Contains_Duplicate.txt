Solution: Use a HashSet, which maintains only the unique items from the data. Copy the array elements,
so the hashset will store each element once. Two options for solving this:
1. I made the hashset from the array values, and if they had the same length, that meant that they had no duplicates. Otherwise, it did.
2. Loop through the array and try to add the elements to the hashset. If it is already containing the element that you are trying to add, return true. Otherwise, 
return false when you are done looping.
